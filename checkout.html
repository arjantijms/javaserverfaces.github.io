<p>
    Mojarra currently has two different version control repositories available.
    You'll need to use the correct repository dependending on which version
    of JSF you're interested in working with.
</p>
<p>
    It should be noted that in order to commit changes, you must have developer
    access.  Please see this <a href="http://wikis.oracle.com/display/GlassFish/JavaServerFacesRI#JavaServerFacesRI-HowcanIcontribute%3F">FAQ entry</a> detailing the steps necessary
    to obtain such access.
</p>
<p>
    It's also possible to check out the sources from either repository anonymously.
</p>

<p>
    JSF 2.X development uses Subversion for source control.
    See these <a href="#svn">instructions</a> for checking out the source using
    svn.
</p>

<p>
    JSF 1.2/1.1 development uses CVS for source control.
    See these <a href="#cvs">instructions</a> for checking out the source using
    cvs.  </p>

<p>For the latest version control tags and branches, please see <a href="http://wikis.oracle.com/display/GlassFish/JavaServerFacesRI#JavaServerFacesRI-WhatarethetagsforthecurrentreleasesofMojarra%3F">this FAQ entry</a>.</p>

        <h2>TortoiseSVN client</h2>

        <p>TortoiseSVN is a Windows Explorer shell extension, generally accessed
            via
            the right-click context menu on Explorer windows (including your
            Desktop).</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>If this is your first Subversion checkout, create a folder in
                Windows Explorer to hold all of your Subversion project folders.
                Then create a subfolder for this project.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use Windows Explorer to navigate to the folder created to
                hold
                this project.</p></li>
            <li><p>Select <strong>File - SVN Checkout...</strong>. The SVN
                Checkout
                dialog box will appear. (You may also access this dialog by
                selecting <strong>SVN Checkout...</strong> from the context menu
                presented when you right-click on your Explorer window's
                background.)</p></li>

            <li><p>Enter the URL of the repository:</p>

                <p><code>https://svn.java.net/svn/mojarra~svn/trunk</code>
                </p>

                <p>Click OK. Enter password.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>If you are prompted for authentication information, you must
                provide your username (<code>rlubke</code>) and password.</p>

                <p>Toggle the "save authentication" option to govern whether or
                    not
                    your username and password will be stored on your system. If
                    left unselected, future invocations of TortoiseSVN will
                    prompt
                    you again for this information.</p>

                <p>Click OK. Enter password.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>You will see list of files scrolling by as the project data
                is
                checked out into your folder.</p></li>
            <li><p>Repeat the project checkout process for each additional
                Subversion project you wish to check out.</p></li>
        </ol>

    <div class="h2" id="cmdlinesvn">

        <h2>Subversion command-line client</h2>

        <p>The Subversion command-line client (<code>svn</code>) is used at a
            command shell, such as in a Command Prompt window on the Windows&reg;
            platform, or any number of available shells on a flavor of Unix.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Use <code>svn checkout</code> to checkout this project's main
                (<code>trunk/</code>) development branch:</p>

                <p><code>svn checkout
                    https://svn.java.net/svn/mojarra~svn/trunk</code></p>

            </li>
            <li><p>You will see list of files scrolling by as the project data
                is
                checked out into your folder.</p></li>
            <li><p>Repeat the project checkout process for each additional
                Subversion project you wish to check out.</p></li>

	  <li><p>When you check out the code in this way, it is checked
	  out anonymously.  When you try to write to the repository,
	  your are prompted for your java.net id and password.  Only if
	  your credentials are correct and you have the permission to
	  write to the repository can you successfully do so.</p>


          <p>You can supply --username and --password arguments to the
          checkout command if you have the proper permissions.</p></li>

<p>In all cases with CVS and java.net you must use CVS+SSH.  Follow the
instructions on <a
href="http://java.net/projects/help/pages/GeneratingAnSSHKey">generating
an SSH key</a>, including the all-important step of installing the key
to your java.net profile.  Once you've done that, you must configure
your CVS client to use SSH. There are many resources on the web for
doing so, and this one was tested and known to work: &lt;<a
href="http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/">http://help.github.com/mac-key-setup/</a>&gt;.
There are similar instructions for other operating systems. Generally,
you have to set the CVS_RSH environment variable to point to your ssh
binary.  After your client is configured, you have to install the ssh key into java.net by following <a href="http://java.net/projects/help/pages/ProfileSettings#SSH_Keys">the instructions about profile settings</a>.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions for the CVS client specific to your operating
system for setting up CVS+SSH and note that the CVSROOT value is <br />
<code>:ext:&lt;USERNAME&gt;@java.net/cvs/javaserverfaces-sources~cvs-repository</code><br /> 

where <code>&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code> is your java.net user name.  A value
of "guest" (without quotes) may work, but this hasn't been verified.
Thus to checkout the sources for the latest development version of JSF
1.2 you would do:</p>

<code><pre>cvs -d $CVSROOT checkout -r JSF_1_2X_ROLLING .</pre></code>

<p>The trailing "." is very significant.  Likewise for JSF 1.1 you would
do:</p>

<code><pre>cvs -d $CVSROOT checkout -r JSF_1_1_ROLLING .</pre></code>

        <p>
            If you wish to contribute to the project's CVS repository, you must
            have "write" permissions as a project member.

            <strong>Note: If your site requires an SSH tunnel for security
