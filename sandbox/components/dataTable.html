    <div class=app>
    <p>Renders an HTML "table" element compliant with the HTML 401
    specification.  Render the "caption" facet, if present, inside a
    "caption" element immediately below the "table" element.  If the
    "captionClass" attribute is specified, render its value as the
    value of the "class" attribute on the "caption" element.  If the
    "captionStyle" attribute is specified, render its value as the
    value of the "style" attribute on the "caption" element.</p>
    <p>Please consult the javadoc for <code>UIData</code> to
    supplement this specification.  If the "styleClass" attribute is
    specified, render its value as the value of the "class" attribute
    on the "table" element.  Any pass-through attributes are also
    rendered on the "table" element.  </p>
    
    <p>Column Groups</p>
    
    <ul>
    
    <p>If the <code>UIData</code> component has a "colgroups" facet,
    render its contents.  Consistent with the rules of facets in
    general, this facet must have only one child.  In general, this
    will be a <code>panel group</code> component that will contain
    <code>colgroup</code> and <code>col</code> elements per the HTML
    Table specification.  Use of column grouping can improve
    accessibility.  This facet must be rendered before the table
    header and footer.</p>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>Rendering the header</p>
    
    <ul>
    
    <p>If the <code>UIData</code> component has a "header" facet, or
    any of the child <code>UIColumn</code> components has a "header"
    facet, render a "thead" element.  If the <code>UIData</code>
    component has a "header" facet, encode its contents inside of "tr"
    and "th" elements, respectively.  Output the value of the
    "headerClass" attribute of the <code>UIData</code> component, if
    present, as the value of the "class" attribute on the "th".
    Output the number of child <code>UIColumn</code> components of the
    <code>UIData</code> component as the value of the "colspan"
    attribute on the "th".  Output "colgroup" as the value of the
    "scope" attribute on the "th" element. </p>
    
    <p>If any of the child <code>UIColumn</code> components has a
    "header" facet render a "tr" element.  For each
    <code>UIColumn</code> that actually has a "header" facet, render
    it inside of a "th" element.  Columns that don't have a "header"
    facet cause an empty "th" element to be rendered.  Output the
    value of the "headerClass" attribute of the <code>UIColumn</code>
    component, if present, as the value of the "class" attribute on
    the "th".  If the "headerClass" attribute of the
    <code>UIColumn</code> component is not present, output the value
    of the "headerClass" attribute of the <code>UIData</code>
    component, if present, as the value of the "class" attribute on
    the "th".  Output "col" as the value of the "scope" attribute on
    the "th" element.
    </p>
    
    <p>Close out the "thead" element.</p>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>Rendering the footer</p>
    
    <ul>
    
    <p>Follow the same process as for the header, except replace
    "header" with "footer", "th" with "td", "thead" with "tfoot", and
    "headerClass" with "footerClass".  Do not render any "scope"
    attribute for the footer.</p>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>Rendering the table body</p>
    
    <ul>
    
    <p>Look at the value of the "bodyrows" attribute.  If present,
    this must be a comma separated list of integers.  Each entry in
    this list is the row index of the row before which a "tbody"
    element should be rendered.</p>
    
    <p>If there was no "bodyrows" attribute, or it was empty, render a
    "tbody" element.  Keep track of the result of the "rows" property
    on the <code>UIData</code> component.  Keep track of the number of
    rows we have rendered so far.  Iterate through the rows.  Set the
    "rowIndex" property of the <code>UIData</code> component to be
    correct as we iterate through the rows.  Stop rendering children
    and close out the "tbody" element if the "rowAvailable" property
    of the <code>UIData</code> returned false.  If the current row
    index is contained in the "bodyrows" attribute, check if a "tbody"
    start element was rendered that needs to be closed, and if so,
    close the "tbody" element.  Then render a "tbody" element start.
    Otherwise, do not render a "tbody" element.</p>
    
    <p>Output a "tr" element.  Output the value of the "rowClasses"
    per the attribute description below.  For each
    <code>UIColumn</code> child, if the column component has a
    "rowHeader" attribute with a value of "true", output a "th"
    element with a "scope" attribute with the value of "row".
    Otherwise, if the column component has no "rowHeader" attribute,
    or its value is false, output a "td" element.  In either case
    attach the value of the "columnClasses" attribute of the
    <code>UIData</code> component per the attribute description below.
    Recursively encode each child of each <code>UIColumn</code> child.
    Close out the "td" or "th" element.  When done with the row, close
    out the "tr" element.  When done with all the rows, close out the
    "tbody" element.</p>
    </ul>
    
    <p>When done rendering all the rows, set the "rowIndex" property of
    the <code>UIData</code> to -1, and close out the "table"
    element.</p>
