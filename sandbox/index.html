        The JavaServer Reference Implementation SandBox is a sandbox area for 
        RI developers to work on components, both visual and non-visual. Its 
        current offerings include an 508 compliant data table, a multi-file 
        upload component, and the beginnings of JSF wrappers for the Yahoo! 
        UI JavaScript component library.  For details on the components offered, 
        including sample code and screen shots, please select a component
        from the menu to the left (Sandbox->UIComponents).
