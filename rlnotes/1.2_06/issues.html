    <p>Known issues with the 1.2_06 FCS release.
    <ul>      
      <li>
        <p>The default renderer for
          <code>h:dataTable</code> doesn't produce accessible markup - specifically no
          <code>scope</code> attribute is rendered on table rows (see issue
          <a href="http://jsf.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=341">341</a>).
        </p>
      </li>    
      <li>
          <p>
              If rendering multiple forms in the same view, and attempting to validate
              via the W3C validator, there will be warnings regarding duplicate
              IDs (javax.faces.ViewState).  The spec currently requires that for
              each Form we output the state info with the ID and Name of
              <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code>.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              When upgrading from 1.2 to 1.2_01, 1.2_02, or 1.2_03, 1.2_04, or 1.2_05 on Tomcat 5.x
              with Facelets, the user may receive a ClassNotFoundException
              for com.sun.faces.config.GlassFishConfigureListenener.  In order
              to resolve this, delete the tld cache references under
              <code>TOMCAT_HOME/work</code> and restart the server.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              When upgrading to 1.2_05 or later while running on a Servlet 2.4 container
              the following error may be encountered:
          </p>
          <pre>
              com.sun.faces.config.ConfigurationException: CONFIGURATION FAILED!Unable to parse document 'file:/C:/develop/Java/Tomcat
-5.5.25/work/Catalina/localhost/server/loader/com/sun/faces/jsf-ri-runtime.xml': This parser does not support specificat
ion "null" version "null"
          </pre>
          <p>
              This error indicates the version of JAXP being used with the container
              is not compliant with JAXP 1.3 or later.  Refer to the container's documentation
              for details on how to upgrade JAXP.
          </p>
      </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In the JSF-RI 1.1 series it was possible to use jsp:include with nested
                jsp:params.  This is no longer possible with JSF-RI 1.2.  This is
                not a true backwards compatibility issue.  The fact that it worked in 1.1
                was due to a side-effect of a workaround for a Tomcat 4 bug.  Had this
                workaround be removed, usage of jsp:param would have failed.  We've evaluated
                potential ways to enable this functionality in 1.2, but have decided
                that this issue will not be resolved.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Server side state saving doesn't work within a cluster (see <a href="http://jsf.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=662">Issue 662</a>).
            The suggested work around is to use client side state saving.
            A fix is available in the 2007-11-29 nightly build and will be officially
            available in 1.2_07.
        </li>
        <li>
            UIData incorrectly discards nested input state when a validation error
            occurs with an element outisde of the UIData (see <a href="http://jsf.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=660">Issue 660</a>).
            There is no workaround for this, but has been an issue for some time.
            A fix is available in the 2007-11-28 nightly build and will be officially
            available in 1.2_07.
