    <p>Known issues with the 1.2_04 P02 release.
    <ul>      
      <li>
        <p>The default renderer for
          <code>h:dataTable</code> doesn't produce accessible markup - specifically no
          <code>scope</code> attribute is rendered on table rows (see issue
          <a href="http://jsf.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=341">341</a>).
        </p>
      </li>    
      <li>
          <p>
              If rendering multiple forms in the same view, and attempting to validate
              via the W3C validator, there will be warnings regarding duplicate
              IDs (javax.faces.ViewState).  The spec currently requires that for
              each Form we output the state info with the ID and Name of
              <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code>.  In the next version, we'll
              add a switch (disabled by default) which will provide unique IDs
              for each of the fields.
              See issue <a href="http://jsf.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=433">443</a>.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              When upgrading from 1.2 to 1.2_01, 1.2_02, or 1.2_03, 1.2_04, on Tomcat 5.x
              with Facelets, the user may receive a ClassNotFoundException
              for com.sun.faces.config.GlassFishConfigureListenener.  In order
              to resolve this, delete the tld cache references under
              <code>TOMCAT_HOME/work</code> and restart the server.
          </p>

             Backwards Compatibility:  In JSF 1.1, the view was built and rendered at the same
             time.  This methodology had an interesting side effect with non-component tags
             such as f:loadBundle when rendering a composite view.
        </p>
         <p>
             Example:  A simple JSP view that is pulled together via jsp:includes.  Each
                       included fragment uses a f:loadBundle tag that refers to a different
                       basename, but <em>use the same var name</em>.
          </p>
         <p>
             With how JSF 1.1 rendered, the above scenario would make each request
             scoped ResourceBundle behave as if it was scoped to the page it was first
             referred to and allow this case to work.
           </p>
         <p>
             In JSF 1.2, the build and rendering are two separate steps, so applications
             that leveraged how 1.1 handled the above scenario now fail as the last
             f:loadBundle action to be invoked at the time of building the view, will be
             the ResourceBundle that will be in scope during the entire render process.
         </p>
         <p>
             There is no work around for this case.  The application will require modification
             in order to work with 1.2.  The application will need to be modified to
             provide unique <code>var</code> names in each fragment, or it will need
             to write a custom component that exposes the ResourceBundle during the
             rendering phase.
