    <p>Known issues with the 1.2_07 FCS release.
    <ul>      
      <li>
        <p>The default renderer for
          <code>h:dataTable</code> doesn't produce accessible markup - specifically no
          <code>scope</code> attribute is rendered on table rows (see issue
          <a href="http://jsf.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=341">341</a>).
        </p>
      </li>    
      <li>
          <p>
              If rendering multiple forms in the same view, and attempting to validate
              via the W3C validator, there will be warnings regarding duplicate
              IDs (javax.faces.ViewState).  The spec currently requires that for
              each Form we output the state info with the ID and Name of
              <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code>.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              When upgrading between versions of Mojarra on Tomcat 5.x
              the user may receive a ClassNotFoundException when attempting to
              start the application.  The class not found could be any one of the
              following: GlassFishConfigureListener, ReflectionUtils$ReflectionUtilsListener,
              or WebappLifecycleListener.  These listeners may be removed between
              releases in which case, when upgrading this failure will occur because
              Tomcat caches the classnames of the listeners when processing an
              application the first time to reduce the time it takes to scan all of
              a web application's configuration resources.  Unfortunately, Tomcat
              doesn't force a rescan when a cached listener isn't found and instead
              just throws an Exception.  To resolve this issue, delete all tldCache.ser
              files found under <code>TOMCAT_HOME/work</code> and restart the server.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p>
              When upgrading to 1.2_05 or later while running on a Servlet 2.4 container
              the following error may be encountered:
          </p>
          <pre>
              com.sun.faces.config.ConfigurationException: CONFIGURATION FAILED!Unable to parse document 'file:/C:/develop/Java/Tomcat
-5.5.25/work/Catalina/localhost/server/loader/com/sun/faces/jsf-ri-runtime.xml': This parser does not support specificat
ion "null" version "null"
          </pre>
          <p>
              This error indicates the version of JAXP being used with the container
              is not compliant with JAXP 1.3 or later.  Refer to the container's documentation
              for details on how to upgrade JAXP.
          </p>
      </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                In the JSF-RI 1.1 series it was possible to use jsp:include with nested
                jsp:params.  This is no longer possible with JSF-RI 1.2.  This is
                not a true backwards compatibility issue.  The fact that it worked in 1.1
                was due to a side-effect of a workaround for a Tomcat 4 bug.  Had this
                workaround be removed, usage of jsp:param would have failed.  We've evaluated
                potential ways to enable this functionality in 1.2, but have decided
                that this issue will not be resolved.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
            There is a chance for an NPE in com.sun.faces.application.WebappLifecycleListener
            with some configurations (see issue
          <a href="http://jsf.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=670">670</a>).
            Take for example, installing JSF in a container such that JSF will be available to
            all web applications.  The NPE will occur for an application that doesn't have the
            FacesServlet defined within it's web.xml.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workaround for this issue is, within the global web.xml for the container
                (JBoss and Tomcat both have one) add either a FacesServlet definition (no mapping)
                or add the context init parameter, com.sun.faces.forceLoadConfiguration, with a value
                of true.
                NOTE: GlassFish is not affected by this issue.
