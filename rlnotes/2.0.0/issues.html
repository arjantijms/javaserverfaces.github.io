    <h3>Differences between the implementation and the specification</h3>
    <p>
        The following JSF 2.0 MR items represent bugs that will be resolved in
        the next revision of the JSF specification series, however, they were
        deemed important enough to include in the 2.0.0 implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
        See the official <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/Jsf2MR1ChangeLog">changelog</a>
        for the complete list of items targeted for the next revision of the specification.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The renderkit documentation for the new OutcomeTarget renderers is incorrect.
            The correct documentation can be found <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/Jsf2MR1ChangeLog#ChangeC006">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            The javadocs for UIViewRoot.setBeforePhaseLister() in 2.0 is incorrect.  Please refer to the 1.2
            version of the documentation for the correct behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
            The documentation for h:outputStylesheet current states that the renderer
            will always render the media attribute with a value of 'screen'.  The implementation
            will not render any media attribute.  For the next release, a media attribute
            will be exposed to give page authors control of this value.
        </li>
        <li>
            The documentation for ui:insert does not include the 'name' attribute.
            This attribute works as per Facelets 1.1.x.
        </li>
        <li>
            The documentation for f:valueChangeListener does not include a reference
            to the for attribute necessary to attach ValueChangeListeners to composite
            components.  Even though it's not documented, the attribute is supported.
        </li>
        <li>
            The documentation for composite:attribute incorrectly lists the 'targets' attribute
            as required.
        </li>
        <li>
            Section 2.6.1.3 of the JSF 2.0 specification states that versioning of resources
            included on the classpath must be supported.  Due to differences in how application
            servers expose classpath URLs, this feature could not be portably implemented.  As
            such, these feature is no longer supported.  Resource versioning for resources included
            in /resource of the application's docroot, will, however, continue to work as specified.
        </li>
        <li>
            Section 5.6.2.1 states that the 'cc' implicit object returns the result of
            UIComponent.getCurrentCompositeComponent().  The implementation does not do this
            as it causes problems when nesting composite components.  Instead, the composite component
            will resolve to the composite component relative to the composite component markup page in
            which the expression appears.
        </li>
        <li>
            The specification was mistakenly silent on a feature that required the evaluation of
            EL expressions within css resources served by the ResourceHandler.  
        </li>
        <li> 
	    The specification does not require that &lt;script&gt; tags be evaluated when returned as part of a Ajax update response.  This was an oversight - Mojarra will evaluate these scripts as part of the update, and the specification will add this in the MR.
        </li>
