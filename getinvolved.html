    <p>There are many ways to become involved in an open source project like the JavaServer
    Faces Reference Implementation.  Whether your interests lie in testing or documentation,
    or your inclination is writing code, there's a place on the development team for just 
    about anybody.  The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.glassfishwiki.org/gfwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JavaServerFacesRI#section-JavaServerFacesRI-HowCanIContribute">FAQ</a> 
    details the steps necessary to become involved formally with the
    development effort, but you are always welcome to hang out on the mailing lists, or, if
    you prefer, on IRC (##jsf on irc.freenode.net).</p>
    
    <p>To help you get to know your development team better, here is a list of all those on
    the development team, with a short bio of each contributor:</p>
